# iOS Photo Lightning

"AVCam demonstrates how to use the AV Foundation capture APIs for recording movies and taking still images. There is a record button for recording movies, a camera button for switching between front and back cameras (on supported devices), and a still button for taking still images. It runs only on an actual device, either an iPad or iPhone, and cannot be run in the simulator." https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/AVCam/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010112
